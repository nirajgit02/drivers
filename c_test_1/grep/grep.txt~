------->we are opening a file by taking filename from command line and string to be searched.
	If number of argument does not match or file name is not present then we are terminating program.
	Now we are counting the size of longest line present in the file.
	rewind the file pointer to starting of file.
	Again fetching 1-1 line from file of length l_size(longest line)and storing it in a char array of string.
	Now comparing the string that user entered with the line of string we fetched from file.
	doing this till end of file,if part of string matches,we are printing that line.

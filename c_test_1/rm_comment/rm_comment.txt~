}

------->taking file name from command line,if file is absent terminate program giving proper msg.
	If file is present we are creating a new file named "data.c".
	We are fetching 1 char by char and if it is not '/' we are copying it to "data.c".
	if two consecutive '//' arrives i will not copy char till '\n' arrives.
	repeating this till end of file.
	after completing this i am removing the original file which has comments.
	Renaming the "data.c" file which does not hve comments as original filename.

------->display finction will display the current value of 'i'.
	I am calling display() 4 times from main.
	If the integer 'i' in dispaly() is not static ,it will initializes the value of i=6 every time the display() is called because it will 		create 'i' each time function stack frame is created and gets destroyed as function scope is over.
	But here due to static word given it will allocate memory once as it is stored in data section.

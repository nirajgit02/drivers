------>here we are doing bitwise & operation of num with 1 to check whether 0th bit is set or not.
	If 0th bit is set we are incrimenting count by 1.
	Then right shif the number one time and doing bitwise & with 1 to check whether 1st bit is set or not.
	repeating these steps untill number becimes zero will give the number of counts for set bits.

//to count the number of 1's bits in given number 
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int num,count=0;

	printf("enter a value\n");
	scanf("%d",&num);

	while(num)
	{
		if(num&1)
		{
			count++;
		}
		num=num>>1;
	}

	printf("number of 1 in given value is %d\n",count);


}

------>here we are doing bitwise & operation of num with 1 to check whether 0th bit is set or not.
	If 0th bit is set we are incrimenting count by 1.
	Then right shif the number one time and doing bitwise & with 1 to check whether 1st bit is set or not.
	repeating these steps untill number becimes zero will give the number of counts for set bits.

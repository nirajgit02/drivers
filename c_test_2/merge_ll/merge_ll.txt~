-------->Create two linklist using insert() function.
	 I am passing addr of both the head ptr of linklist to merge().
	 In merge() i am collecting it with double pointer.
	 In merge() i am comparing each data of 2nd linklist with all nodes data of 1st linklist till the pointor to 1st ll reaches null.
	 If any node data of 2nd linklist matches with node data of 1st linklist then do not merge and check for nxt data.
	 If it does not match with any data put address of that node in last node of 1st linklist.
	 Now break that node from 2nd linklist by placing \0 in its nxt.
	 Repeat this till end of 2nd linklist.

rev_link():- curr is pointing to 1st node of linklist.
	     Two pointers nxt and pre is pointing to null.
	     If curr->next is not zero make nxt to point at next node of linklist.
	     Put addr in pre to curr->next,in this it is null.so now 1st node is pointing to null.
	     Now put curr addr in pre and make curr to point nxt node.
	     Repeat these untill curr->next is not null.
